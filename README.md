# üõçÔ∏è Project Overview
### Ecommerce Control Management System

This project is an **Ecommerce Control Management System** built specifically with small and medium-sized businesses in mind. It provides a streamlined, intuitive environment for managing products, orders, discounts ‚Äî all from a centralized admin panel.

The platform is designed to give business owners maximum flexibility: most of the store content and behavior can be adjusted independently, without requiring technical expertise. From configuring product categories and prices to handling discounts and shipping options, the system puts full control into the hands of the shop owner.

Beyond simple product management, the system ensures complete oversight of the **entire order lifecycle** ‚Äî including payment status, stock synchronization, and automated cleanup of abandoned orders. It's a practical toolset tailored to real-world needs, with usability and customization at its core.
